SQL:
====
* SQL is a pprogramming language that is used to manage and manioukate relational datavases.
* SQL deals with structured data, that is data whihc is organized in tables.

Main categories of SQL Commands:
================================
1. DDL(Data definition language)
2. DML(Data manipulation language)
3. DCL(Data control language)
4. TCL(Transaction control language)

Data Definition:
================
* SQL Provides commands to define that str of a database, collectively known as Data Defintion language.
* some of DDL commands:
1. Create: Used tocreated tables, ddatanase, indexes etc..
2. Alter: Used tomodify the existing databases objects(eg: add or remobve columns)
3. Drop: Used to delete entire databases, tales etc..

Manilupating Data:
==================
* Data manipulation language(DML)
* Tells to insert, upadte or delete

* Select: Retrives data from one or more tables.
* Insert: Adds new records in to a table.
* Upadte: modifies existing records ina table.
* Delete: Removes records from table.

Data Control Language:
======================
* DCL commands are used to control access to data in a database.

* Grant: Gives a user access privileges to database objects.
* Revoke: Removes access privileges from user. 

TCL:
====
* TCL commands are used to manage transactions withina database, ensure data integrity and consistency.
1. Commit: Savel allchanges made during the current transaction.
2. ROllback: Undoes changes made during the current transaction.
3. Savepoint: Sets a point within transaction to which you can roll back.
4. SET transaction: configures transaction properties.

* The main advantage using sql is uniquity: nearly every relationaldb system supports SQL:


SQL in MYSQL:
=============
* Mysql is one of the most popular opensource relational database systems that implements SQL. Here's How SQL typically is used with MYSQL.
1. Write SQL statements in a client (Mysql CLI or GUI like Mysql Workbench).
2. Receive results, either in text from (CLI) or tabular data(GUI).

* Simple EX CLI or GUI 
-- 1. Create a database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS my_sample_db;
-- 2. Use the created database
USE my_sample_db;
-- 3. Create a table within the database
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
-- 4. Insert data into the table
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES
('Alice Smith', 'alice.smith@example.com'),
('Bob Johnson', 'bob.johnson@example.com'),
('Charlie Brown', 'charlie.brown@example.com');
-- 5. Fetch data from the table
SELECT * FROM users;
-- Optional: Fetch specific columns and filter data
SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE id = 2;

To display version:
===================
select version();
