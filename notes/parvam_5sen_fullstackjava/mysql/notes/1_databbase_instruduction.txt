What is Database?
=================
* A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system
* Databases allows for data to be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated and deleted.

Key characteristics of databases
================================
1. Persistent storage: Data is stored over long term, surviving application restarts and system reboots.
2. Structured and Orgaized: data is systematically arranged to avoid duplication an inconsistency.
3. Easily Retrivable: Efficient methods exist for querying, filtering, and retrieving.
4. Concurrent Access: Multiple isers and applications can use the database simultaneously without corruptign data.
5. Security and Integrity: Access can be controlled and data can be protected against unauthorized user or corruption.

Why use a database:
===================
1. to efficitently handle large volumes of data and ensure fast retrievel.
2. to maintain a permanent record of information.
3. to backup and recover data in case of hardware failures or data corruption.

What is DBMS(database management system):
=========================================
* It is a software that manages a datbases, handling data storage, retrieval, updates and security.
* It acts as an interface between database and users/applications.

Examples:
=========
1. relational DBMS (RDBMS): Mysql, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL server.(Tables)
2. NoSQL DBMS: MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB.(Document)
3. In-memory DBMS: Redis, Memcached.(RAM)

Mysql:
======
* It is a popular open-source RDBMS.

Introduction to the Relational Data Model:
==========================================
* The relational data model organizes data into one or  more tables(also known  as relations) with rows and columns
* The idea, introduced by E.F Codd in 1970 revolutionized how databases are structured and queried.

Key Concepts in the Relational Model:
=====================================
1. Tables(Relations): A table represents an entity or a concept for ex: EMployees, Customers etc...
2. Columns(Attributes): COlumns defined the type of data stored. for ex: Employees have emp_id, first_name. 
* All rows in the same column share the same type and meaning of data.
3. Rows(Records): Each row in the table represents a single instance or a record. for ex: one rows in employee tble represents one specific empliyee
4. Keys: Primary Key & Foreign Key.
5. Relationships Between Tables: 1:1,1:M & M:M

Real-world Example:
===================
Imagine a small company that needs to store about employees, departments and projects.
*In employees table store dept_id, project_id.

Primary Key:
============
* A Column or set of columns that uniquely identify each row in a table. for instance emp_id is a primary  key if it is uniquely identifiess every employee.

Foreign Key:
============
* A column in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. for Example: a dept_id  in employee table that references the dept_id in department table.

One to One:
===========
* Each row in Table A is related to exactly one row in Table B. For exaample one employee have one unique company car assigned.

One to Many:
============
* One rrow in TableA can be associated with multiple rows in Table B. one department can have many employees.

Many to Many:
=============
* Multiple rows in Tabble A can be assiciated with multiple rows in Table B. for ex: employees can work on multiple projects and projects can ahve multiple employee.

Why the Relational Model?
=========================
1. Data integrity:
==================
* By using primary and foreign keys the relational model enforces referential integrity. That means no orphaned records should exist(eg an employee record that refer to department taht doe't exist)
* Reduced Redudancy:Through the process of normalization.
* Flexibility in Querying: SQL (str'ed Query Language)
